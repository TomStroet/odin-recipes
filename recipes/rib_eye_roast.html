        <li>Beat butter and garlic together in a small bowl until combined.</li>
        <li>Poke several holes in rib eye with a sharp knife. Rub butter mixture all over meat and season generously with salt and pepper. Place rib eye fat-side up in a roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes to develop a crust.</li>
